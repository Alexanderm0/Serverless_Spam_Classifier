# Serverless Spam Classifier
This project features a serverless machine learning pipeline for classifying emails as either spam or not spam. 

### Data source
The dataset used for this implementation is 'Spambase', taken from the UCI machine learning repository which can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase/

### Application
The trained model will be featured in a Huggingface application in which users can input text and test it on being classified as spam. As a use-case, one could use the model to test whether their email will be classified as spam before sending it out.
